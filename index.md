# Autonomous RC Car 
## Bates Raspberry Pi Short Term Class 2017


### May 3 2017
	This is the first day we have really begun to work on the project. The goal for today was to take apart the RC car we bought and begin to understand how it works. Because some of our parts were still in the mail we spent a good portion of the day reading tutorials and working with OpenCV. By the end of the session our Pi's camerea could recognize faces using OpenCv.
